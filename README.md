# Abstractive Document Summarization Using Machine Learning Approach

We present a novel divide-and-conquer strategy for neural summary of large
documents. Our solution makes use of the documentâ€™s discourse structure
and sentence similarity.Divide the task into smaller summarization chal-
lenges.We divide a lengthy document and its summary into numerous source-
target pairs, which are then used to train a model. learns to sum up each
section of the document individually After The partial summaries are then
combined to form a final comprehensive summary. In contrast to the con-
ventional approach, we may break down the challenge of long document
summary into smaller pieces and simpler problems, reducing computational
complexity and increasing the number of training examples while also reduc-
ing There is noise in the target summaries. There are two publicly available
datasets.

ral Language Processing) etc.
